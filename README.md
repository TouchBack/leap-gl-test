Leap Motion OpenGL Test
=======================

Hooray, graphics!

Notes
-----
* Requires Python 2.7 (though other versions *may* work - **untested!**)
* Requires Leap Motion device software to be installed
* Require PyOpenGL to be installed
* Crappy 2D graphics (for now)
* Uses Leap Motion SDK (version 1.0.9)
